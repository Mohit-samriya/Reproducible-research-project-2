Reproducible-research-project-2
===============================

This is assignment 2 from the course Reproducible Research on coursera. [URL for data analysis](http://rpubs.com/Faiyaz/191150) 

Introduction
------------

Storms and severe weather can have a tremendous negative impact both economically and in public health of communities and municipalities. Forseeing and preventing fatalities, injuries and property damage from such  extreme events is a key concern.  

In this project we explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks: characteristics of major storms and weather events in the U.S., when and where they occur, and estimates of fatalities, injuries and property damage.

Data
----

The data for this website is in the form of a csv file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm. The file can be downloaded from:  

* https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2  

Information regarding some of the variables can be found at:

* National weather service [Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)  

* National Climatic Data Center Storm Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)

7. At least one figure in the document containing a plot. [DONE]  
8. At most 3 figures in the document. [DONE]  
9. Start analysis from raw data (original .csv.bz2 file). [DONE]  
10. Address question of which types of events are most harmful to population health. [DONE]  
11. Address question of which types of events have the greatest economic consequences. [DONE]  
12. The entire analysis should be reproducible. DONE[]  
13. Descriptive  captions of figures, i.e. description near the figure of what is happening in the figure. [DONE]  

### Assignment

* Explore the NOAA Storm Data base and answer basic questions about sever weather events.  
* Use datasets to answer the questions below and show code for entire analysis.  
* Analysis should consist of tables, figures and other summaries.  

### Questions

Address the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?  
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?  

Write your report as if it were to be read by a government or a municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events. No need to make any specific recommendations in the report.

### Document layout

* Title
* Synopsis  
* Data processing section: Consider using cache = TRUE for certain code chunks.  
* Results section  
* Atleast one figure  
* No more than 3 figures  
* Show all your code, i.e. ensure that echo = TRUE.  

### Publishing my analysis

Publish document in RPubs and include URL in README file. Include PDF file on Github repo as well.
